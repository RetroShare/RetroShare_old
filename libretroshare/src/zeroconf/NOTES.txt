The Code in this directory refers to APPLEs ZeroConf Library.

We have two classes: p3ZeroConf & p3ZeroConfNat
The first provides ZeroConf(Bonjour) discovery services.
The second provides UPnP & NAT-PMP Nat Port Forwarding.

OSX
----------------
Both should compile with no problems under OSX.
Both will be compiled by default.

p3ZeroConf is enabled by default.
p3ZeroConfNAT will become the default PortForwarding Service (once tested).

Windows
----------------
Under Windows, you require Apple's header files & library to compile.
If you are missing the libraries, you can disable their compilation in libretroshare.

Furthermore - it'll only work if the Apple DNS Service is running on the Windows PC.
p3ZeroConf will be enabled by default (if included in the compilation).
p3ZeroConfNAT will not be enabled by default.

Linux
----------------
Neither of these classes will compile or be enabled under Linux.
There is another library: Avahi - which provides ZeroConf services.
It is likely to have a totally different interface - 
so it will have to be coded up separately.
