<h3>Connect to Friends</h3>

<p>
Be Online at the same time, and RetroShare will automatically connect you!
</p>

<p>
Your client needs to find the RetroShare Network before it can make connections.
This takes 5-30 minutes the first time you startup RetroShare
</p>

<p>
The DHT indicator (in the Status Bar) turns Green when it can make connections.

</p>

<p>
After a couple of minutes, the NAT indicator (also in the Status Bar) switch to Yellow or Green.

</p>

<p>
If it remains Red, then you have a Nasty Firewall, that RetroShare struggles to connect through.

<p>
Look in the Further Help section for more advice about connecting.
