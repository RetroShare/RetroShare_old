List of fixes/improvements before 0.6
=====================================

   Posted:
      [ ] it's not possible to create a Posted thread without a Owner. 
          Bug? If not, then remove "No signature" from selection box
      [ ] Show an info page for unsubscribed posted threads (same as forums)
   
   Forums
      [ ] it's not possible to create a Forum thread without a Owner. 
          Bug? If not, then remove "No signature" from selection box
      [X] the tooltip over GXS ids should show the avatar on the left side.
		[ ] fix data race between GXS ID default icons
   
   GUI General
      [ ] do we keep "Getting Started" ? the look needs to be improved
   
   Messages
      [ ] distant messages should be made async-ed
      [ ] distant messages are not re-sent when the peer is offline the first time
      [ ] sent messages to direct peers in the Sent box have inconsistent To field. 
          Raises an error if you click on it.
   
   Channels
      [ ] Unsubscribed channels should show an info page when selected, like forums
      [ ] marking all as read in channels takes time. The channel icon should show a waiting clock 
          during the operation to avoid the user to re-click many times in the hope to get 
          the posts marked as read.
   
   Chat lobbies
      [ ] Chat lobbies should use Identities. That's a significant change, probably not backward compatible. 
   
   Chat
      [ ] Distant chat window should show GXS avatars
      [ ] Distant chat should work with shared identities
      [X] You should not be enabled to distant-chat yourself!
   
   Identities:
      [X] "Owned by you" => "Owned by node [nodename]" 
      [X] Bold face should only be used for keys with admin credentials
      [ ] reputations are not used yet. We should hide them.
      [ ] Add timeout to Identities that are unused. Need to keep a time stamp list, updated 
          whenever the identity is used for checking signatures.
   
   Network
      [ ] Friends => Friend nodes
   
   News feed
      [X] remove the Ghost news feed items
      [ ] remove the double feed publication
