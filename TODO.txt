       Posted:

       Forums
E        [X] it's not possible to create a Forum thread without a Owner. 
             Bug? If not, then remove "No signature" from selection box
         [X] the tooltip over GXS ids should show the avatar on the left side.
         [X] fix data race between GXS ID default icons
         [X] Share of key shows "Not implemented". Since forums are public, share key should be hidden.
      
       GUI General
E        [ ] do we keep "Getting Started" ? the look needs to be improved
E        [ ] Recommendation messages do not show complete links. Links show up in some buttons and the text is truncated

M        [ ] sound is not working for some users on linux. We also need a "test sound" button in config->sound.

         [X] display version ID in windows version
E        [ ] recommended friends messages have embedded buttons of wrong size.  Use RSLinks instead!

       Messages

M        [ ] distant messages are not re-sent when the peer is offline the first time

M        [X] icons for GxsTreeWidgetItem are too small in distant messages list widget
E        [ ] "from" should be disabled until we actually use a GXS id in the destination list.
E        [ ] "show all" and "show everyone" in destination list are duplicate names for different things. 
             Either remove one of them, or use appropriate names.
      
       Channels
         [X] Unsubscribed channels should show an info page when selected, like forums
H        [X] marking all as read in channels takes time. The channel icon should show a waiting clock 
             during the operation to avoid the user to re-click many times in the hope to get the posts marked as read.
         [X] channels items show a 0 left to the up/Dn buttons. What is it??
         [ ] allow to post on channels when attachment is not in shared files. Just display a warning.
      
       Chat lobbies

       Identities:
         [X] "Owned by you" => "Owned by node [nodename]" 
         [X] Bold face should only be used for keys with admin credentials
E        [X] reputations are not used yet. We should hide them.
H        [X] Add timeout to Identities that are unused. Need to keep a time stamp list, updated whenever the identity is used for checking signatures. 
         [X] Fix avatar loading for identities. When loaded for the first time by forums, the avatar does not show up.
M        [ ] allow to share identities between locations. 
      
       Network
